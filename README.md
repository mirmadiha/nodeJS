# Node.js Learning Repository

This repository contains my practice code, experiments, and small projects as I learn Node.js. It serves as a simple and flexible space to track my progress.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is meant to:

* Keep all my Node.js practice files in one place
* Help me experiment with different concepts as I learn them
* Document my growth over time in a straightforward way

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any project or file in this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mirmadiha/nodeJS
cd nodeJS
npm install   # Only if the specific folder/project uses dependencies
node <filename>.js
```

(Some folders may have their own instructions, but the setup stays simple.)

---

## 🗂 Structure

Each folder represents a concept, topic, or mini‑project I explored while learning. The structure will grow naturally as I continue learning.

## 🤝 Contributions

This repository is mainly for personal learning, but feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
